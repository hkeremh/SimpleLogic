SimpleLogic makes the tedious job of creating truth tables and logic equations easy!
## How to Use
To use SimpleLogic, simply enter the `Create Logic` section, add the inputs and the outputs of your functions and start editing your logic functions. You can can do so by adjusting the three ways to represent your functions:
  1. The logic equation 
  2. The sum of minterm
  3. The truth table.
  <p/>
When you adjust one of these representations the other two will change accordingly. This way, you can easily obtain the truth table or the reduced logic equation of a function! Have fun!
